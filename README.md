# Linkdin_Insights_Scrapper
This project is a FastAPI application that acts as a LinkedIn Insights Scraper and API. It uses SQLAlchemy and a MySQL database to efficiently store scraped company pages and posts. The API prioritizes database lookup (caching) before triggering web scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
